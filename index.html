<!-- SECTION 1: OBJECTIVES -->
<div class="section" id="objectives">
<h2>1. Our Objectives</h2>
<p>This project aims to document and analyze how cinema has represented the Sri Lankan ethnic conflict, a devastating 26-year civil war that profoundly shaped the nation's history and identity. Through film, we can witness different perspectives, understand the human cost of war, and explore how art captures collective memory and trauma.</p>
<h3>Primary Goals:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Create a comprehensive database of feature films, short films, and documentaries that address the Sri Lankan ethnic conflict between the Tamil and Sinhala communities.</li>
<li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Examine how different filmmakers—both local and international—have portrayed the war, its causes, its impact on civilians, and its aftermath.</li>
<li><strong>Preservation:</strong> Preserve knowledge of these important cultural artifacts, many of which faced censorship or limited distribution due to their sensitive subject matter.</li>
<li><strong>Education:</strong> Provide a resource for students, researchers, and anyone interested in understanding the Sri Lankan conflict through the lens of cinema.</li>
<li><strong>Critical Engagement:</strong> Encourage viewers to think critically about how war is represented in media and how different narratives emerge from conflict.</li>
</ul>
<!-- SECTION 2: CIVIL WAR -->
<div class="section" id="civil-war">
<h2>2. The Sri Lankan Civil War: A Brief Explanation</h2>
<h3>Historical Background</h3>
<p>The Sri Lankan Civil War was an armed conflict fought on the island of Sri Lanka from 1983 to 2009. The war was fought between the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a separatist militant organization fighting to create an independent Tamil state in the northern and eastern regions of Sri Lanka.</p>
<h3>Root Causes</h3>
<p>The conflict had deep historical roots stemming from ethnic tensions between the majority Sinhala community (approximately 75% of the population) and the minority Tamil community (approximately 18% of the population). Key factors included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Colonial Legacy:</strong> British colonial policies created divisions and competitive relationships between ethnic communities.</li>
<li><strong>Language Policy:</strong> The 1956 Sinhala Only Act made Sinhala the sole official language, marginalizing the Tamil-speaking population.</li>
<li><strong>Educational Discrimination:</strong> Policies that limited Tamil access to university education created feelings of systematic discrimination.</li>
<li><strong>Political Representation:</strong> Tamil communities felt underrepresented in government and sought greater autonomy.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Inequality:</strong> Perceived economic marginalization of Tamil regions fueled resentment.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The War Years (1983-2009)</h3>
<p>The civil war officially began in July 1983 with anti-Tamil riots known as "Black July," which resulted in the deaths of hundreds (possibly thousands) of Tamils. This violence drove many Tamils to support armed resistance, particularly the LTTE led by Velupillai Prabhakaran.</p>
<p>The 26-year conflict was marked by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guerrilla warfare and conventional military operations</li>
<li>Suicide bombings and assassinations (including the assassination of Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991)</li>
<li>Displacement of over one million people</li>
<li>Estimated 60,000-100,000 deaths (numbers vary by source)</li>
<li>Widespread human rights violations by both sides</li>
<li>Use of child soldiers by the LTTE</li>
<li>Government military offensives and sieges</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Final Phase (2009)</h3>
<p>The war concluded in May 2009 when Sri Lankan military forces defeated the LTTE in a final offensive. The last months of the war were particularly brutal, with tens of thousands of civilians trapped in the war zone. International organizations have documented alleged war crimes by both government forces and the LTTE during this period, including indiscriminate shelling, summary executions, and denial of humanitarian aid.</p>
<h3>Aftermath and Legacy</h3>
<p>The end of the war did not immediately bring reconciliation. Issues that remain include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accountability for war crimes and disappearances</li>
<li>Rehabilitation of former combatants</li>
<li>Resettlement of internally displaced persons</li>
<li>Political solutions for Tamil autonomy and representation</li>
<li>Reconciliation between communities</li>
<li>Military presence in former conflict zones</li>
<li>Memory, memorialization, and truth-telling</li>
</ul>
<div class="note">
<strong>Note on Perspective:</strong> The civil war remains a deeply contested subject with different communities holding different narratives about its causes, conduct, and consequences. This project acknowledges multiple perspectives while maintaining focus on how cinema has attempted to capture these complexities.
                </div>
<div class="placeholder">
<strong>📝 ADD YOUR ANALYSIS:</strong> Include your group's perspective on specific aspects of the civil war that are particularly relevant to your film analysis. Consider discussing specific events, regions, or themes that appear frequently in the films you've studied.

<!-- SECTION 3: MEDIA REPRESENTATION -->
<div class="section" id="media">
<h2>3. Local and International Media: How They Represented the Civil War</h2>
<h3>The Power and Politics of Representation</h3>
<p>Media representation of the Sri Lankan civil war has been deeply contested, with local and international outlets often providing dramatically different narratives. Cinema, as a form of media, has played a crucial role in shaping public understanding and collective memory of the conflict.</p>
<h3>Local Sri Lankan Media</h3>
<h4>Government-Aligned Media</h4>
<p>State-controlled and pro-government media in Sri Lanka often portrayed the conflict as a clear fight against terrorism, emphasizing:</p>
<ul>
<li>The LTTE as a terrorist organization threatening national security</li>
<li>Heroic narratives of the Sri Lankan military</li>
<li>Limited coverage of civilian casualties caused by government forces</li>
<li>Patriotic framing emphasizing national unity</li>
<li>Censorship of dissenting voices or alternative perspectives</li>
</ul>
<h4>Independent and Alternative Media</h4>
<p>Independent journalists and filmmakers in Sri Lanka faced significant challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Censorship and self-censorship due to security concerns</li>
<li>Harassment, threats, and violence against journalists covering sensitive topics</li>
<li>Difficulty accessing conflict zones</li>
<li>Films critical of the war effort were often banned or faced distribution challenges</li>
<li>Several filmmakers received death threats or were forced into exile</li>
</ul>
<div class="note">
<strong>Example:</strong> Director Vimukthi Jayasundara's film "The Forsaken Land" (2005) won the Caméra d'Or at Cannes but was banned in Sri Lanka. The director received death threats and eventually relocated to France.
                </div>
<h3>International Media</h3>
<h4>Western News Coverage</h4>
<p>International media coverage was often sporadic and limited:</p>
<ul>
<li>The conflict received relatively little attention compared to other global conflicts</li>
<li>Coverage intensified during major incidents (assassinations, major offensives)</li>
<li>Final phase of the war (2009) received significant international scrutiny</li>
<li>Human rights organizations documented alleged war crimes by both sides</li>
<li>Debate over whether the conflict was terrorism vs. liberation struggle</li>
</ul>
<h4>International Documentary Films</h4>
<p>International documentarians provided alternative perspectives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"No Fire Zone" (2013):</strong> Channel 4's investigation into war crimes during the final phase generated international controversy and was banned in India</li>
<li><strong>"My Daughter the Terrorist" (2007):</strong> Norwegian documentary examining LTTE female fighters</li>
<li>These films often had better access to international distribution but faced political pushback</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cinema as Counter-Narrative</h3>
<p>Filmmakers, both local and international, have used cinema to challenge dominant narratives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Humanizing the "Other":</strong> Films like "Me Mage Sandai" (2000) and "Alimankada" (2009) explored relationships between Sinhalese and Tamils, humanizing both sides</li>
<li><strong>Civilian Perspectives:</strong> Many films focus on ordinary people caught in the conflict rather than combatants or politicians</li>
<li><strong>Post-War Trauma:</strong> Recent films examine the psychological and social aftermath of war</li>
<li><strong>Artistic Resistance:</strong> Filmmakers used cinema as a form of resistance against censorship and official narratives</li>
</ul>
<h3>Challenges in Representation</h3>
<p>Representing the civil war through media has been complicated by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Competing narratives about who were "victims" and "perpetrators"</li>
<li>Difficulties in accessing reliable information from conflict zones</li>
<li>Propaganda from both government and LTTE</li>
<li>Diaspora communities' influence on international perceptions</li>
<li>Ongoing political sensitivities even after the war's end</li>
<li>Questions of truth, memory, and reconciliation</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Dheepan</em> is a 2015 French drama that follows a former Tamil Tiger fighter who flees Sri Lanka after the civil war, arriving in France with a fake family (a woman and a young girl, both strangers) to improve their chances of asylum. The film explores their attempts to build a new life in a hostile Parisian housing project while dealing with their traumatic pasts and the violence in their new environment.</p>
<h3>Historical Significance</h3>
<p>This film is particularly significant because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It brought international attention to the Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora experience</li>
<li>The lead actor, Antonythasan Jesuthasan, is himself a former LTTE member turned author and actor</li>
<li>It won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, the highest prize in international cinema</li>
<li>It examines post-war trauma and refugee experiences from a unique perspective</li>
<li>It's directed by acclaimed French director Jacques Audiard, bringing a Western cinematic lens to a South Asian conflict</li>
</ul>
<div class="note">
<strong>Discussion Point:</strong> Consider how this film, made by a French director about Tamil refugees in France, differs from films made by Sri Lankan directors about the conflict on Sri Lankan soil. What perspectives are gained or lost in this cross-cultural representation?
